# This repository have an example of HTTP requests using axios!
Axios is a Javascript lib that can be used to make HTTP requests and also use the promise feature!
This program was made with 3 more libraries, concurrently, live-server and json-server. Those libraries can run a fake API that listens the HTTP requests made through axios.

## How to start the project:
1 - clone the repository into a empty folder.<br>
2 - navigate to the repository and open a terminal.<br>
3 - use the following command: npm run start-dev <br>

Then a webpage will open and you are ready to go! Use this program to learn all the features from axios ;)<br>

P.S: This program was inspired by https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-axios-166cb0035237
